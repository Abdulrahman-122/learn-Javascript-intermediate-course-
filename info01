Classes in Js
  - class Surgeon{
  constructor(name,department){
    this.name=name;  // this is called property (this.name or whatever )
    this.department=department;

  }
}

// we use constructor to build an instance of the class 
// focus on the syntax of class very well 

--
// instance -> is an object created from the class that has the properties under constructor
// we called new to make that instance.

example ;


class Surgeon {
  constructor(name, department) {
    this.name = name;
    this.department = department;
  }
}
let surgeonRomero=new Surgeon('Francisco Romero','Cardiovascular');

let surgeonJackson=new Surgeon('Ruth Jackson','Orthopedics');

How to make getter methods or method inside class ;
ex;
In the Surgeon constructor, prepend the name and department properties with an underscore (_) to indicate they should not be accessed directly.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Inside the constructor, add a property named _remainingVacationDays and set it equal to 20.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

Under the constructor, create a getter called name that returns the value saved to _name.
Checkpoint 4 Passed

4.

Under the .name() getter, create a getter called department that returns the value saved to _department.
Checkpoint 5 Passed

5.

Under the .department() getter, create a getter called remainingVacationDays that returns the value saved to _remainingVacationDays.
Checkpoint 6 Passed

6.

Under the .remainingVacationDays() getter, create a method called takeVacationDays that accepts one argument named daysOff.

Inside the method, subtract daysOff from the number saved to _remainingVacationDays. Set _remainingVacationDays to the result.

//notes
// we added _ before name or department to indicate that they can't change directly 
// note that -> getter has  keyword get
// any method doesn't have any keyword behind it in class;
// also ; you don't need to add data type for any parameter inside method you define as JS is dynamically types which means accept any type 
class Surgeon {
  constructor(name, department,//daysOff(you don't need this also inside constructor) {
    this._name = name;
    this._department = department;
    this._remainingVacationDays=20 ;
   //this._daysOff;  you can delete this from here 
  }
  get name(){
    return this._name ;
  }
  get department(){
    return this._department;
  }
  get remainingVacationDays(){
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  takeVacationDays(){
    this._remainingVacationDays-= daysOff;
  }
}

const surgeonRomero = new Surgeon('Francisco Romero', 'Cardiovascular');
const surgeonJackson = new Surgeon('Ruth Jackson', 'Orthopedics');

how to write an instance and get the return from gettter methods ; 
.

At the bottom of main.js, use console.log() and the .name getter to print the value saved to the _name property of the surgeonRomero object.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Call .takeVacationDays() on surgeonRomero, with an input of 3.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

After the call to .takeVacationDays(), use console.log() and the .remainingVacationDays getter to print the value saved to the _remainingVacationDays property of the surgeonRomero instance.

solution;
class Surgeon {
  constructor(name, department) {
    this._name = name;
    this._department = department;
    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
  }
  
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get department() {
    return this._department;
  }
  
  get remainingVacationDays() {
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  
  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
  }
}

const surgeonRomero = new Surgeon('Francisco Romero', 'Cardiovascular');
const surgeonJackson = new Surgeon('Ruth Jackson', 'Orthopedics');

console.log(surgeonRomero.name); // check this
console.log(surgeonRomero.remainingVacationDays)
surgeonRomero.takeVacationDays(3); //check this
console.log('After takeing the vacation days the rest of days for you is ;')
console.log(surgeonRomero.remainingVacationDays)

Inheritance in Js
  - we have superclass which bring it's properties to it's child class  
ex; 
1.

In the next few exercises, you will create two subclasses (Doctor and Nurse) from a parent class named HospitalEmployee. Below, we have listed the properties and methods you will find in the Doctor and Nurse classes.
Doctor

    Properties: _name, _remainingVacationDays, _insurance
    Methods: .takeVacationDays()

Nurse

    Properties: _name, _remainingVacationDays, _certifications
    Methods: .takeVacationDays(), .addCertification()

In main.js, create a parent class named HospitalEmployee based on the shared properties and methods. Add a constructor method with name as a parameter.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Within the constructor, set the instance’s _name to name and _remainingVacationDays to 20.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

Under the constructor, create getters for your _name and _remainingVacationDays properties, called name and remainingVacationDays respectively.

Within each getter, return the respective property’s value.
Checkpoint 4 Passed

4.

Under the getters, add a method called takeVacationDays.

This method should accept one argument, called daysOff.

Inside the method, subtract daysOff from _remainingVacationDays. Save the result to _remainingVacationDays.
solution;
class HospitalEmployee{
  constructor(name){
    this._name=name;
    this._remainingVacationDays=20;
  }
   get name(){
      return this._name;
    }
    get remainingVacationDays(){
      return this._remainingVacationDays;
    }
    takeVacationDays(daysOff){
      return this._remainingVacationDays-=daysOff ;
    }

}

class Doctor {
  constructor(name,insurance){
    this._name=name;
    this._insurance=insurance;
    this._remainingVacationDays=20;
  }
  takeVacationDays(daysOff){
    return takeVacationDays-=daysOff;
  }
   get name(){
      return this._name;
    }
    get remainingVacationDays(){
      return this._remainingVacationDays;
    }
    takeVacationDays(daysOff){
      return this._remainingVacationDays-=daysOff ;
    }
}
class   Nurse{
    constructor(name,addCertifications){
      this._name=name;
      this._addCertification=addCertifications;
      this._remainingVacationDays=20;
    }
    get name(){
      return this._name;
    }
    get remainingVacationDays(){
      return this._remainingVacationDays;
    }
    takeVacationDays(daysOff){
      return this._remainingVacationDays-=daysOff ;
    }
    addCertification(certification){
      return certification++;
    }

}

now you should know how you can extends parent class into the child class using two keywords; extends(extends the parent class into the child class),super(means take the properties from the parent that against that property)
ex;
1.

In this exercise, you will begin to create the Nurse class as a child of the HospitalEmployee class. The Nurse class has the following properties and methods:
Nurse

    Properties: _name, _remainingVacationDays, _certifications
    Methods: .takeVacationDays(), .addCertification()

Under HospitalEmployee, create an empty class named Nurse that extends HospitalEmployee.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Inside the Nurse class, create a constructor that accepts two parameters. Use the list of properties from the previous step to name these arguments. Order the parameters in the same way they are listed.

Check the hint if you need help.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

In the Nurse constructor, call the parent’s constructor method and pass the appropriate value(s).
Checkpoint 4 Passed

4.

Inside the Nurse constructor, under the call to super(), set _certifications based on the corresponding argument.
Checkpoint 5 Passed

5.

Under the Nurse class, create a new instance of Nurse and save it to a constant variable named nurseOlynyk. Pass in the following values for each property:

    name: 'Olynyk'
    certifications: ['Trauma', 'Pediatrics']

solution;
class HospitalEmployee {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
  }
  
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get remainingVacationDays() {
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  
  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
  }
}


class  Nurse extends HospitalEmployee{
  constructor(name,certifications){
    super(name);
    this._certifications=certifications;
  }
}

const nurseOlynyk=new Nurse('Olynyk',['Trauma','Pediatrics'])
---
how to call the property inside any class (child class) after extends it with parent (super) class
ex;
Call .takeVacationDays() with an input of 5 on your nurseOlynyk instance.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Under the method call, log the value saved to the _remainingVacationDays property in nurseOlynyk using the corresponding getter method.
solution;
class HospitalEmployee {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
  }
  
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get remainingVacationDays() {
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  
  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
  }
}

class Nurse extends HospitalEmployee {
 constructor(name, certifications) {
   super(name);
   this._certifications = certifications;
 } 
}

const nurseOlynyk = new Nurse('Olynyk', ['Trauma','Pediatrics']);
nurseOlynyk.takeVacationDays(5);
// check log it to the console
console.log(nurseOlynyk._remainingVacationDays)

output;
15
---
this is also shows you how to access the properties of class
ex;
1.

Use the properties and methods below to help you complete the tasks that follow.
Nurse

    Properties: _name, _remainingVacationDays, _certifications
    Methods: .takeVacationDays(), .addCertification()

Under the Nurse constructor, add a .certifications() getter that returns the value saved to the Nurse instance’s _certifications property.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Add a method called addCertification under the .certifications() getter.

This method should accept one input, newCertification. Inside the method, use the push() method to add the newCertification value to the nurse’s _certifications array.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

At the bottom of main.js, call .addCertification() on nurseOlynyk with an argument of 'Genetics'.
Checkpoint 4 Passed

4.

Using the .certifications() getter, log the value saved to the _certifications property of nurseOlynyk to the console.
solution;
class HospitalEmployee {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
  }
  
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get remainingVacationDays() {
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  
  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
  }
}

class Nurse extends HospitalEmployee {
  constructor(name, certifications) {
    super(name);
    this._certifications = certifications;
  } 
  get certifications(){
    return this._certifications ;
  }
  addCertification(newCertification){
    this._certifications.push(newCertification);
  }
}

const nurseOlynyk = new Nurse('Olynyk', ['Trauma','Pediatrics']);
nurseOlynyk.takeVacationDays(5);
console.log(nurseOlynyk.remainingVacationDays);


nurseOlynyk.addCertification('Genetics');
// nurseOlynyk.certifications();
console.log(nurseOlynyk._certifications);
output;
Output-only Terminal
Output:

15
[ 'Trauma', 'Pediatrics', 'Genetics' ]
notes;
  -as you make more subclass your readability of your program will increase + efficeincy will increase
---
now let's build a static function within class and access it through an instance(objects) of subclass(child calss) and parent class itself and see what is the output .
ex;
1.

Within the HospitalEmployee class, create a static method called generatePassword. When it’s called, this method should return a random integer between 0 and 10000.
solution;
class HospitalEmployee {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
  }
  
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get remainingVacationDays() {
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  
  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
  }
  static generatePassword(){
    return Math.floor(Math.random()*10001);   // this will return a number between 0;10000 
  }
}

class Nurse extends HospitalEmployee {
  constructor(name, certifications) {
    super(name);
    this._certifications = certifications;
  } 
  
  get certifications() {
    return this._certifications;
  }
  
  addCertification(newCertification) {
    this.certifications.push(newCertification);
  }
}

const nurseOlynyk = new Nurse('Olynyk', ['Trauma','Pediatrics']);
nurseOlynyk.takeVacationDays(5);
console.log(nurseOlynyk.remainingVacationDays);
nurseOlynyk.addCertification('Genetics');
console.log(nurseOlynyk.certifications);
// nurseOlynyk.generatePassword(); // this line will return an error as there this function is static so we can't access it through subclass instead we will access it through it's class(parent class )
 console.log(HospitalEmployee. generatePassword());
console.log(Nurse.generatePassword())
output;
Output-only Terminal
Output:

Loading Complete
Output-only Terminal
Output:

15
[ 'Trauma', 'Pediatrics', 'Genetics' ]
7630
4544
notes;
we use extends to extend parent class on child class
we use super to call a property from parent into child class
any class is a template of instances(objects)
only the static methods we can't access it through instance of the class instead we can call it through the calss itself  and it's childs also 




at the end you should review the objects in Js in the beginner repo I did to understand more
